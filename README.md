# 10-Minutes-Meditative-Machine
10 Minutes Meditative Machine is a useless linguistic machine that challenges the conventional relationship between humans and Large Language Models.
In this work, both GPT and the user are called to process the same input, but only the user is tasked with producing an expressed output.
GPT’s own elaboration remains internal and unexpressed: its unspoken literature stays hidden, much like a human does not reveal to another person most of their reflections on a specific topic.
The standard scheme is inverted: This elaborative but non-responsive chatbot is not the user's tool, it's the real user that asks for an output.
